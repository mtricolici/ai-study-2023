Several machine learning models can be used to train a system to unblur images. Here are a few options:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
CNNs are particularly well-suited for image processing tasks like deblurring due to their ability to capture spatial patterns and relationships in images.

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
GANs excel at generating realistic images, making them a good choice for deblurring tasks.

- Autoencoders:
Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns to encode an input image into a latent representation and then reconstruct the original image from that representation.

- Deep Image Prior (DIP):
DIP is a deep learning approach that utilizes a prior distribution over natural images to guide the deblurring process.

- Neural Style Transfer:
Neural style transfer techniques can be adapted for deblurring tasks. These methods learn to transfer the style of reference images, such as sharpness and texture
