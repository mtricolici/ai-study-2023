Improving the performance of an EDSR (Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution) model beyond the 
quality of Lanczos resizing can be challenging,
but there are several strategies you can employ to potentially enhance the results.
Here are some suggestions based on your provided code:

- Increase Model Complexity: Your current model uses 16 residual blocks and 64 filters.
Increasing the number of residual blocks or filters may improve the model's ability to learn 
more complex features, but be aware of the increased computational cost.

- Advanced Residual Blocks: Consider implementing more advanced residual block designs.
For example, Residual Blocks with attention mechanisms (like Channel Attention or Spatial Attention) 
can often yield better results by focusing on more relevant features.

- Change Activation Functions: You're currently using LeakyReLU with a fixed alpha of 0.2.
Experiment with different activation functions or parameters, like PReLU or a different alpha 
value for LeakyReLU, to see if they offer any improvement.

- Use a Different Loss Function: While MSE (Mean Squared Error) is a common choice, it doesn't always 
correlate well with human perception of image quality.
Consider using loss functions that better align with human visual perception,
such as perceptual loss or GAN-based (Generative Adversarial Network) losses.

- Learning Rate Scheduling: Implement a learning rate scheduler if you haven't already.
Reducing the learning rate as training progresses can lead to more stable and precise model weights.

- Data Augmentation: If you're not already using data augmentation, it can be beneficial.
Techniques like random crops, rotations, flips, and color adjustments can make 
the model more robust and improve generalization.

- Upsampling Techniques in Residual Blocks: Experiment with different upsampling techniques within the residual blocks.
Sometimes, a combination of upsampling methods at different points in the network can yield better results.

- Fine-tuning on Specific Data: If your model is intended for specific types of images (like photographs, medical images, etc.),
fine-tuning the model on a dataset similar to your target domain can significantly improve results.

- Batch Normalization: You might want to experiment with the placement and parameters of Batch Normalization layers,
or consider alternatives like Group Normalization or Layer Normalization.

- Regularization Techniques: Implementing or adjusting regularization techniques like dropout
or L2 regularization might help in achieving a more generalized model.

- Evaluation Metrics: Ensure you're using suitable evaluation metrics.
PSNR is a standard metric, but metrics like SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) or 
even qualitative assessments can provide additional insights into model performance.

- Experiment with Different Optimizers: Although Adam is a solid choice, experimenting with 
other optimizers like SGD with momentum or RMSprop might yield different results.
