- CNN VAE - done
- MLP VAE - done
- LSTM-based VAE - if image data has a time-series or sequential nature
- Residual VAE (ResVAE) -  Incorporate residual connections, similar to residual networks (ResNets), into your VAE architecture. Residual connections can help with training deeper VAEs and improve reconstruction quality.
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with VAE (VAE-GAN) - Combine the strengths of VAEs and GANs, can help produce high-quality and diverse image samples
- Auto-Regressive VAE: Use auto-regressive models like PixelCNN or PixelRNN for the decoder in a VAE
