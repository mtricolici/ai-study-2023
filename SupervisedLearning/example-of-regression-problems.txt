Energy Consumption Forecasting: Given historical data on energy consumption (e.g., electricity, gas), a regression model can be trained to predict future energy usage. The target variable (energy usage) is continuous, making this a regression problem.


Customer Lifetime Value Prediction: Given data on various features of customers (e.g., purchase history, demographics, customer interactions), a regression model can be trained to predict the expected lifetime value of a customer to a business. The target variable (lifetime value) is continuous, making this a regression problem.

Employee Productivity Prediction: Given data on various features of employees (e.g., job type, work environment, experience), a regression model can be trained to predict the expected productivity of an employee. The target variable (productivity) is continuous, making this a regression problem.

Network Traffic Prediction: Given data on various features of network traffic (e.g., packet size, time of day, network topology), a regression model can be trained to predict the expected amount of network traffic for a given period of time. The target variable (network traffic) is continuous, making this a regression problem.
