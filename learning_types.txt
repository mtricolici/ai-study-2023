Types of ML:

1. Supervised learning - the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the target variable (i.e., the output) is known
   The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on the given data

   example1: Given a set of emails, the algorithm can be trained to classify each email as either spam or not spam
   example2: Given a set of handwritten digits, the algorithm can be trained to classify each digit as a number between 0 and 9.

2. Unsupervised learning - the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, where the target variable is not known
   The algorithm learns to discover patterns and relationships in the data without any guidance.

   example1: clustering - groups similar data points together
   example2: dimensionality reduction - reduces the number of features in the data
   example3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic - A cybersecurity company wants to identify anomalies in network traffic to detect potential cyber attacks.
   The company has a large dataset of network traffic data, but it is not clear how to identify patterns of abnormal behavior.
   The company decides to use unsupervised learning and clustering to identify patterns of normal behavior, and 
   to flag any instances that deviate significantly from these patterns.

3. Semi-supervised learning - the algorithm is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data

   example: Credit Card Fraud Detection
   A credit card company wants to improve its fraud detection system, but there is a limited amount of labeled data available
   The company decides to use semi-supervised learning to leverage both the labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance.
   step1: train a supervised learning model on the limited amount of labeled data
   step2: use this model to predict the labels of the large amount of unlabeled data
   step3: use the expanded dataset (labeled and predicted) to retrain the model.
   This process can be repeated iteratively to improve performance.

4. Reinforcement learning - the algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment.
   The algorithm receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, which it uses to adjust its actions in order to maximize the rewards.

   example: AI learns to play Snake (2d game). AI is equipped with sensors that provide input about the game state.
   for example: the positions of the food and obstacles.
   and AI must learn to take actions that maximize its score.
   AI receives a reward (or penalty) based on its actions, and over time it learns to make decisions that maximize its score.

5. Deep learning - uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn representations of the data

   example: Natural Language Processing. NLP model is trained on a large dataset (books, articles, facebook posts...)
   NLP model can do various tasks: language translation, sentiment analysis, or question answering etc
   The system can generate human-like responses to questions or prompts, and it can understand the context and meaning of complex language structures.

6. Transfer learning - a pre-trained model is used as the starting point for a new task.
   The pre-trained model has already learned useful features from a large dataset, which can be applied to a new, smaller dataset to improve performance.

   example: to be defined

7. Online learning - the algorithm learns from data that is received in a continuous stream, rather than in batches.
   tasks such as fraud detection or recommendation systems, where new data is constantly being generated.

8. Bayesian learning - the algorithm makes use of Bayesian inference to update its beliefs about the parameters of a model as it receives new data.
   Bayesian learning is particularly useful for problems where there is uncertainty in the data or the model.

Note: there're many many other types of ML :)
